            Project-186 is always growing. In general, the most important goal of the Project is to spread itself, to solidify
            itself as a meme, and to recognize a shared vision for the future. More specific goals can be found on our goals page.

            Problems such as social isolation, a lack of fulfillment, or dependencies on technology are common in modern
            settings, almost paradoxically: shouldn't progress exist in order to relieve suffering, rather than create it? Even
            if you do not personally struggle, you likely have family or friends who do. Through Project-186, societal progress
            will be reoriented in order to improve the lives of all.

            Project-186 defines itself as a natural part of humanity’s evolution. Fundamentally, the Project believes that
            individuals must hold themselves accountable for their actions and embrace the future in order for humanity to
            progress. The philosophy of Project-186 can be understood further through the pillars and resources.

            The Project is based on Christianity, Islam, or any other well-established world religion. The Project introduces a <i>new perspective</i>,
            which attempts to expand the definitions of <i>religion</i> and <i>faith</i> to represent more pure, practical, and personal action.
            At first glance, it may seem muddy, but upon study and devotion, the faith reveals itself naturally.

            “The scripture of TKS” is a document which can be read here which introduces the religion of TKS. The Project is
            partially built on top of TKS, understanding it for what it is, while creating new representations to carry out the
            greater vision.

      <span class="q">I: Potential</span>
      <span class="arrow" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="acc-answer" id="a-pillar-potential" role="region" aria-labelledby="q-pillar-potential" hidden>
      <p>Project-186 believes that human potential must be protected and valued. Everybody’s potential is different, but potential is infinite: there are always ways to improve.</p>
      <p>The Project believes that individuals should be held accountable for how they pursue their potential and where they place their faith. It is unreasonable to judge somebody based on what they are or what they believe, as factors like these are generally outside of one’s control.</p>
      <p>The acceptance of faith and the decision to embrace a greater pursuit of perfection can only be a personal decision; an individual cannot be forced to accept faith into their heart. It is therefore only along this decision where judgement is reasonable. This is the line which Project-186 attempts to approximate: can we build a better future by individuals improving theirselves and seeking a greater potential?</p>
      <p>Coercion is impossible: the role of Project-186 is to reveal the door, to show glimpses of the glory of it in order for individuals to pursue it themselves.</p>
      <p>The complexity of action, decision, and consequence make this a difficult challenge, but an important one. More thorough explanations can be found here.</p>
    </div>

  <article class="acc-item">
    <button class="acc-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a-pillar-acceptance" id="q-pillar-acceptance">

      <span class="arrow" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="acc-answer" id="a-pillar-acceptance" role="region" aria-labelledby="q-pillar-acceptance" hidden>
      <p>Project-186 knows that new technologies must be accepted as being a part of the world. The Project criticizes certain uses of technology, but we do not attempt to stop progress; as we understand that this is impossible.</p>
      <p>Alignment of future progress is more important, and more practical than attempting to destroy past progress.</p>
      <p>Part of this pillar is accepting that completion and varying incentives of global entities will inevitably lead to the refinement and the development of technologies.</p>

  <article class="acc-item">
    <button class="acc-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="a-pillar-decentral" id="q-pillar-decentral">
      <span class="q">III: Decentralization</span>
      <span class="arrow" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="acc-answer" id="a-pillar-decentral" role="region" aria-labelledby="q-pillar-decentral" hidden>
      <p>Project-186 is not tied to a central authority: the Project is what it is. Anybody can participate, however, the Project is layered on top of several existing structures, which aim to provide a core philosophical and practical baseline for the endeavors of the Project.</p>
      <p>Certain centralized elements are necessary to represent the Project (websites, emails addresses, etc.). But by definition, there is no authority that decides what is “official” or not. As Project-186 grows and refines itself, the ideas held within will approximate common divinity and common truths held by humanity, that aim to build a better future for all humanity.</p>
      <p>While terms like “good” and “divine” can be confusing, and perhaps not always well defined, this is necessary. Decentralization is inherently limited, since no greater authority can define what is “good” and what is, or isn’t, actually part of the project. The ideas of the Project can only proliferate as far as they resonate with people willing to spread them.</p>
      <p>See pillar #4: there should be no monetary incentives for the Project to spread: it only spreads through the faith and commitment of those who choose to be a member of the Project.</p>

    </button>
    <div class="acc-answer" id="a-pillar-advertisement" role="region" aria-labelledby="q-pillar-advertisement" hidden>
      <p>Advertisement is understood by the Project to a corruption of the natural lifecycle of memes. Advertising the Project in exchange for money, or using the popularity of the Project to gain money by advertising things on Project resources, is against this pillar of the Project.</p>
      <p>Some level of advertisement is necessary; for example, if the Project spreads by promoting itself in youtube comments, or physical fliers, than this is a form of advertisement. But the Project understands that advocating for ideas should be voluntary and willing, reflecting human incentives, not financial incentives.</p>

    </button>
    <div class="acc-answer" id="a-pillar-optimism" role="region" aria-labelledby="q-pillar-optimism" hidden>
      <p>Project-186 is optimistic about the future. There may not be a particular reason that optimism is held, but it is a necessary part of building a better future.</p>
      <p>The Project looks at global trends of human suffering, recognizing that on large scales, standards of living, health, and happiness goes up, while suffering, violence, and suppression of freedom goes down. This trend occurs because in time, through new innovations, discoveries, and schools of though, the nature of humanity and the purity of the human soul becomes more clear, so it becomes more obvious that the human soul should be valued and protected, and it becomes easier to execute these.</p>
      <p>The Project plays an important role in ensuring that this trend continues. As tools become better and better and resources more plentiful, the specific methods used to bring about positive human experience become less important, while the ideas and their execution become the primary source of change.</p>
      <p>“Can we create a better world for all?” becomes less important: we certainly can. The more relevant idea is “we must be optimistic so that the better world will manifest in the way we want it to.”</p>

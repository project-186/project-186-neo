      Problems such as social isolation, a lack of fulfillment, or dependencies on technology are common in modern
      settings, almost paradoxically: shouldn't progress exist in order to relieve suffering, rather than create it? Even
      if you do not personally struggle, you likely have family or friends who do. Through Project-186, societal progress
      will be reoriented in order to improve the lives of all.

      Project-186 defines itself as a natural part of humanity’s evolution. Fundamentally, the Project believes that
      individuals must hold themselves accountable for their actions and embrace the future in order for humanity to

      The Project is based on Christianity, Islam, or any other well-established world religion. The Project introduces a <i>new perspective</i>,
       which attempts to expand the definitions of <i>religion</i> and <i>faith</i> to represent more pure, practical, and personal action.
       At first glance, it may seem muddy, but upon study and devotion, the faith reveals itself naturally.

      Project-186 believes that human potential must be protected and valued. The pursuit of potential, is precisely and
      exactly how society improves in order to. Everybody’s potential is different, but potential is infinite: there are
      always ways to improve.

      Project-186 knows that new technologies must be accepted as being a part of the world. The Project criticizes
      certain uses of technology, but we do not attempt to stop progress; as we understand that this is impossible. The
      goal of Project-186 is alignment of future progress, not the destruction of past progress.

      Project-186 is not tied to a central authority: the Project is what it is. Anybody can participate, however, the
      Project is layered on top of several existing structures, which aim to provide a core philosophical and practical
      baseline for the endeavors of the Project. Certain centralized elements are necessary to represent the Project
      (websites, emails addresses, etc.) but by definition, there is no authority that decides what is “official” or not.

      Advertisement is understood by the Project to a corruption of the natural lifecycle of memes. Some level of
      advertisement is necessary; for example, if the Project spreads by promoting itself in youtube comments, or physical
      fliers, than this is a form of advertisement. But the Project understands that advocating for ideas should be
      voluntary and willing, reflecting human incentives, not financial incentives.

      Project-186 is optimistic about the future. There is no particular reason that optimism is held, but it is a

    </button>
    <div class="acc-answer" id="a-obj-animals" role="region" aria-labelledby="q-obj-animals" hidden>
      This is true: the Project is especially focused on human life, as opposed to other conscious beings that certainly
      contain capacity for suffering. This can be roughly understood as follows. The Project doesn’t ubiquitously claim
      that humans are inherently more valuable than any other life form or collection of life forms. But the meaning of
      the Project is only exhitibted through humans - dolphins and pigs can’t understand human language, and therefore
      the Project . Empathy is natural for humans - in a brighter future, empathy will be demonstrated and therefore
      things like animal rights will follow. A declaration of the existence human soul is necessary for a better future.
      Especially as technologies progress and scienific thought furthers, it is necessary to accept the truth that all
      human souls are equal. Without this reality, there is poor ….

    </button>
    <div class="acc-answer" id="a-obj-politics" role="region" aria-labelledby="q-obj-politics" hidden>
      It’s certainly possible that certain political positions may be objectively the “correct” ones. It’s also true that
      the complexity of the world, in this era leads to an obvious facts: politics are not optional, society must be ran
      in one way or another.
      <br><br>
      However, politics are inherently a level above personal action. The Project takes a personal, accountable angle.
      For an analogy consider a car: politics determines the make and model, the shape, the properties of the car. The
      Project ensures that each of the parts is functioning, well-built. Some cars may be better than others; but on an
      individual level; it doesn’t matter, each of the parts must be built as well as possible if the car is going to
      drive.

      On a spiritual level, this is also the paradox that applies to human personal well-being. Human experience

      The Project accepts basic facts: yes, there are people who work two jobs, trying to get by. People that don’t waste

      The Project accepts inequality that exists. The potential of all people are not the same; based on resources,
      wealth, life circumstances, etc.
      <br><br>
      But part of the Project’s pillars is to accept that true perfection is unattainable. It can only be pursued: it can

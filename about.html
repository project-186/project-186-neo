            <p>Project-186 is not a corporation or a centralized organization, Project-186 an idea: a symbol of revolution.</p>
            <p>Project-186 believes that the modern world is abundant with resources, but many of the structures and systems that govern the modern world are not properly aligned with human interests.The Project believes that the natural way to improve the world is through faith: a recognition of individual potential and a strong convicted optimism towards the world.The world is changing, humanity must embrace the Project. Project-186 is a genuine attempt, almost a plea, to aim towards a better future.</p>
            <p>Project-186 is defined as the solution of the problem of alignment of progress.</p>

            <p>The goal is to create an idea, a symbol, a force of thought. Something practical, understandable, something true. Something than can be challenged, but can't be denied, that can be rejected, but can't be avoided. Something natural, simple enough that it's obvious, but complex enough that it never ends. Something that does need a center, it lives on its own, enough to truly inspire you, to move you, to share the truth of it. True inspiration, true freedom. But something that also offers something deep, something real, something personal, almost like a secret, to keep safe.</p>

            <p>Project-186 defines itself as a natural part of humanity's evolution. Fundamentally, the Project believes that individuals must hold themselves accountable for their actions and embrace the future in order for humanity to progress. The philosophy of Project-186 can be understood further through the <a href="comingsoon.html">pillars</a> and <a href="resources.html">resources</a>.</p>

          <div class="acc-answer" id="a-faq-faith" role="region" aria-labelledby="q-faq-faith" hidden>
            <p>The Project is not based on Christianity, Islam, or any other well-established world religion. The Project simply introduces a <em>new perspective</em>. At first glance, it may seem confusing, almost like there's no real religion here, but upon study and devotion, the faith will reveal itself naturally. If you are confused, continue to study the statements and resources of the Project.</p>

          </button>
          <div class="acc-answer" id="a-faq-singularity" role="region" aria-labelledby="q-faq-singularity" hidden>
            <p>It's not clear to the Project exactly when the singularity will occur. It's likely that it's further away than many expect; but it's also much closer than many others expect. Human scales are limited, but even in progress, our hearts beat at the same pace they always have. Therefore, the singularity is perhaps not as dramatic or quick as some expect; it is not a single moment, but rather, it is a process: the final breakthrough.</p>
            <p>The goal is to create a world that allows for the exponentiality of progress to occur naturally while also channelling direction. So, from a human perspective, the singularity shouldn't change much: it's already here, it's not here yet, it makes no difference.</p>

            <p>The <em>scripture of TKS</em> is a document, which can be read <a href="https://verse-668.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, which introduces the <em>religion of TKS</em>.</p>
            <p>TKS and the Project are not the same, the Project is built on top of the religion, and the religion is built as an approximation of goodness, truth, or divinity.</p>

            <p>“NUF” stands for “New Universal Faith”, also called “New Faith”, “Neofaith”, or “Neopolarism”. These terms refer to a more general religion, of which things like Project-186 and TKS are only small parts of.</p>

            <p>Project-186 believes that human potential must be protected and valued. Everybody's potential is different, but potential is infinite: there are always ways to change. </p>
            <p> The Project believes that individuals should be held accountable for how they pursue their potential and where they place their faith. It is unreasonable to judge somebody based on what they are or what they believe. </p>
            <p>The acceptance of faith and the decision to embrace a greater pursuit of perfection can only be a personal decision; an individual cannot be forced to accept faith into their heart. The Project isn't saying the coercion is necessarily right or wrong, but more that it's impossible: the role of Project-186 is to reveal the door.</p>

            <p>Project-186 knows that new technologies must be accepted as being a part of the world. The Project criticizes certain uses of technology, but does not attempt to stop progress. This is impossible: the toothpaste doesn't go back in the tube.</p>
            <p>Whether or not progress, or specific technologies are good, or bad, is not relevant. The important question is: what do we do now?</p>

            <p>Project-186 is not tied to a central authority: the Project is what it is, and only what is it. </p>
            <p>Anybody or anything can be part of Project-186. However, there are existing structures upon which the Project is built, so not <em>everything</em> will be part of the Project; it will grow from the the foundations to the heavens. </p>
            <p>Unavoidably, certain centralized elements are necessary to represent the Project (websites, emails addresses, and so on). But by definition, there is no authority that decides what is “official” or not. As Project-186 grows and refines itself, the ideas held within will approximate common, divine, truths held by humanity, building a better future for all humanity. </p>

            <p>Advertisement is understood by the Project to a <em>corruption of the natural lifecycle of memes</em>. When financial incentives govern ideas rather than the content of the ideas themselves, the priorities no longer align with what is actually true or good for humanity.</p>

            <p>Project-186 looks at global trends of human suffering, recognizing that on large scales, standards of living, health, and happiness goes up, while suffering, violence, and suppression of freedom goes down. </p>
            <p>This is a natural trend of human civilization, and it will continue. However, development reflects humanity: if general human sentiment is that of pessimism and fear, for example of an AI apocalypse, then those outcomes become likely.</p>
